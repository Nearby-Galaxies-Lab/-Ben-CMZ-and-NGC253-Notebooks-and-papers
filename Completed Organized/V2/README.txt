Here I have the results that replicate Krieger 2020, approximately replicate Shetty 2012, and the modified version of the analysis which provides results more consistent--ergo, they do not vary wildly with the parameters of the dendrogram.

###

The files are labelled in alphanumeric order, and include the A and B prefixes for the appendix items that will go in my paper.

###

Steps are broken into data reduction (reprojection), dendrogram calculation, dendrogram analysis, and plotting, labelled 1,2,3,4 respectively. Results are saved to the directory of the ipynb files and a subdirectory called /results files

###

Any errors should be simple to resolve, and are likely caused by a simple difference in numpy, astropy, or astrodendro distributions (or others) or possibly RAM overflow.
